# Leauge-Win-Prediction-AI

This is a test version of AI which is still in development, some items might be missing, and I still need to change some features.

In order to work, you need to download this <https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min> dataset and put it in "datasets" directory in your project directory.

As soon as I finish this project and get some time to test it in my games I'll put pickle file with trained model so downloading dataset won't be required anymore.
